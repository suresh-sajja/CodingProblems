/**
 * Itâ€™s the year 2552, the Humans just won a war against a very powerful alien race that had invaded our solar system.
 * The Human army is in celebration mode! The army has n soldiers. The soldiers are numbers from 1 to n. The army has a
 * superiority hierarchy. Every soldier has one immediate superior. The superior of a superior of a soldier is also a
 * superior to that soldier. So, a soldier may have one or more superiors but only one immediate superior. Every soldier
 * has to congratulate every other soldier. For a pair of soldiers if one of them is the superior of the other, they
 * will shake hands. Otherwise, they will bump their fists. You are given the list of immediate superior of all
 * soldiers. Your job is to tell how many handshakes and fist bumps will be there.
 * NOTE: Among all soldiers there is one
 * soldier who does not have any superior. He is the commander of the whole army.
 * Input:
 * The first line of the input contains t, the number of test cases.
 * The first line of each test case contains n, the number of soldiers.
 * The next line contains n space separated integers. The ith integer represents the immediate superior of the ith soldier. The
 * immediate superior of the commander of the army will be '0'.
 * Output:
 * Output two space separated integers, the number
 * of handshakes and the number of fist bumps.
 * Constraints:
 * 1<=t<=10 1<=n<=100000
 * It is guaranteed that the commander of the army is a superior of all soldiers.
